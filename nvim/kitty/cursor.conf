#: Text cursor customization {{{

 cursor #cccccc

#: Default text cursor color. If set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. Its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. Note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

 cursor_text_color #111111

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

 cursor_shape block 

#: The cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline. Note that
#: when reloading the config this will be changed only if the cursor
#: shape has not been set by the program running in the terminal. This
#: sets the default cursor shape, applications running in the terminal
#: can override it. In particular, shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> in kitty sets
#: the cursor shape to beam at shell prompts. You can avoid this by
#: setting shell_integration to no-cursor.

# cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused.
#: The unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline,
#: hollow and unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

# cursor_beam_thickness 1.5

#: The thickness of the beam cursor (in pts).

# cursor_underline_thickness 2.0

#: The thickness of the underline cursor (in pts).

 cursor_blink_interval -1

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay. You can
#: also animate the cursor blink by specifying an easing function. For
#: example, setting this to option to 0.5 ease-in-out will cause the
#: cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the
#: second it will go from opaque to transparent and then back again
#: over the next half. You can specify different easing functions for
#: the two halves, for example: -1 linear ease-out. kitty supports all
#: the CSS easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>. Note that turning on animations
#: uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple times
#: per blink interval. See also, cursor_stop_blinking_after.

# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking.

# cursor_trail 0

#: Set this to a value larger than zero to enable a "cursor trail"
#: animation. This is an animation that shows a "trail" following the
#: movement of the text cursor. It makes it easy to follow large
#: cursor jumps and makes for a cool visual effect of the cursor
#: zooming around the screen. The actual value of this option controls
#: when the animation is triggered. It is a number of milliseconds.
#: The trail animation only follows cursors that have stayed in their
#: position for longer than the specified number of milliseconds. This
#: prevents trails from appearing for cursors that rapidly change
#: their positions during UI updates in complex applications. See
#: cursor_trail_decay to control the animation speed and
#: cursor_trail_start_threshold to control when a cursor trail is
#: started.

# cursor_trail_decay 0.1 0.4

#: Controls the decay times for the cursor trail effect when the
#: cursor_trail is enabled. This option accepts two positive float
#: values specifying the fastest and slowest decay times in seconds.
#: The first value corresponds to the fastest decay time (minimum),
#: and the second value corresponds to the slowest decay time
#: (maximum). The second value must be equal to or greater than the
#: first value. Smaller values result in a faster decay of the cursor
#: trail. Adjust these values to control how quickly the cursor trail
#: fades away.

# cursor_trail_start_threshold 2

#: Set the distance threshold for starting the cursor trail. This
#: option accepts a positive integer value that represents the minimum
#: number of cells the cursor must move before the trail is started.
#: When the cursor moves less than this threshold, the trail is
#: skipped, reducing unnecessary cursor trail animation.

#: Scrollback {{{

# scrollback_lines 2000

#: Number of lines of history to keep in memory for scrolling back.
#: Memory is allocated on demand. Negative numbers are (effectively)
#: infinite scrollback. Note that using very large scrollback is not
#: recommended as it can slow down performance of the terminal and
#: also use large amounts of RAM. Instead, consider using
#: scrollback_pager_history_size. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

 scrollback_indicator_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the scrollback indicator which is a small colored
#: rectangle that moves along the right hand side of the window as you
#: scroll, indicating what fraction you have scrolled. The default is
#: one which means fully opaque, aka visible. Set to a value between
#: zero and one to make the indicator less visible.

# scrollback_pager less --chop-long-lines --RAW-CONTROL-CHARS +INPUT_LINE_NUMBER

#: Program with which to view scrollback in a new window. The
#: scrollback buffer is passed as STDIN to this program. If you change
#: it, make sure the program you use can handle ANSI escape sequences
#: for colors and text formatting. INPUT_LINE_NUMBER in the command
#: line above will be replaced by an integer representing which line
#: should be at the top of the screen. Similarly CURSOR_LINE and
#: CURSOR_COLUMN will be replaced by the current cursor position or
#: set to 0 if there is no cursor, for example, when showing the last
#: command output.

# scrollback_pager_history_size 0

#: Separate scrollback history size (in MB), used only for browsing
#: the scrollback buffer with pager. This separate buffer is not
#: available for interactive scrolling but will be piped to the pager
#: program when viewing scrollback buffer in a separate window. The
#: current implementation stores the data in UTF-8, so approximately
#: 10000 lines per megabyte at 100 chars per line, for pure ASCII,
#: unformatted text. A value of zero or less disables this feature.
#: The maximum allowed size is 4GB. Note that on config reload if this
#: is changed it will only affect newly created windows, not existing
#: ones.

# scrollback_fill_enlarged_window no

#: Fill new space with lines from the scrollback buffer after
#: enlarging a window.

# wheel_scroll_multiplier 5.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel.
#: Note that this is only used for low precision scrolling devices,
#: not for high precision scrolling devices on platforms such as macOS
#: and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change scroll direction. See
#: also wheel_scroll_min_lines.

# wheel_scroll_min_lines 1

#: The minimum number of lines scrolled by the mouse wheel. The scroll
#: multiplier wheel_scroll_multiplier only takes effect after it
#: reaches this number. Note that this is only used for low precision
#: scrolling devices like wheel mice that scroll by very small amounts
#: when using the wheel. With a negative number, the minimum number of
#: lines will always be added.

# touch_scroll_multiplier 1.0

#: Multiplier for the number of lines scrolled by a touchpad. Note
#: that this is only used for high precision scrolling devices on
#: platforms such as macOS and Wayland. Use negative numbers to change
#: scroll direction.
